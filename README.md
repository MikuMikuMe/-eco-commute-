# **eco-commute**

Creating a comprehensive platform like **eco-commute** that integrates public transport schedules, bike-sharing systems, and ride-sharing options with real-time data analytics and personalized recommendations is a complex task. Below, you'll find a simplified, illustrative version of how you might begin to implement such a platform using Python. This example will demonstrate fundamental components, error handling, and comments to guide you through the process. Please note that real-world implementations would require extensive use of APIs for data retrieval and more advanced techniques for optimizations and recommendations.

```python
import requests
import json
import datetime
from typing import List, Dict

class EcoCommute:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the EcoCommute system."""
        self.public_transport_data_url = "https://api.publictransport.example.com"
        self.bike_sharing_data_url = "https://api.bikesharing.example.com"
        self.ride_sharing_data_url = "https://api.ridesharing.example.com"
        
    def fetch_data(self, url: str) -> Dict:
        """Fetch data from a given URL."""
        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error fetching data: {e}")
            return {}

    def get_public_transport_schedule(self, location: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get the public transport schedule for a specific location."""
        try:
            location_url = f"{self.public_transport_data_url}/schedules?location={location}"

            return transport_data.get('schedules', [])
        except Exception as e:

        """Get the bike-sharing availabilities for a specific location."""
        try:
            location_url = f"{self.bike_sharing_data_url}/availabilities?location={location}"
            bike_data = self.fetch_data(location_url)
            return bike_data.get('availabilities', [])
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error getting bike-sharing availabilities: {e}")
            return []

    def get_ride_sharing_options(self, location: str, destination: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get available ride-sharing options."""
        try:
            ride_sharing_url = f"{self.ride_sharing_data_url}/options?location={location}&destination={destination}"
            ride_data = self.fetch_data(ride_sharing_url)
            return ride_data.get('options', [])
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error getting ride-sharing options: {e}")
            return []

    def find_optimal_commute(self, start_location: str, end_location: str) -> Dict:
        """Find the optimal commute route."""
        try:
            schedules = self.get_public_transport_schedule(start_location)
            bikes = self.get_bike_sharing_availabilities(start_location)
            rides = self.get_ride_sharing_options(start_location, end_location)

            # Here you would implement logic for analyzing and determining the optimal commute.
            # This could be based on time, cost, or environmental impact, among other factors.
            # For demonstration, we'll just return the available options.
            return {
                "public_transport_schedules": schedules,
                "bike_sharing_availabilities": bikes,
                "ride_sharing_options": rides
            }
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error finding optimal commute: {e}")
            return {}

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    eco_commute = EcoCommute()

    # Replace 'Downtown' and 'Uptown' with actual locations and IDs as required by the real APIs
    start_location = "Downtown"
    end_location = "Uptown"

    optimal_commute = eco_commute.find_optimal_commute(start_location, end_location)
    print(json.dumps(optimal_commute, indent=2))
```

### Key Features and comments:
- The `EcoCommute` class encapsulates the logic for handling different commute data sources.
- The `fetch_data` method illustrates basic error handling for network requests using the Requests library. It captures exceptions and informs the user when data cannot be fetched.
- Each method under `EcoCommute` pulls data from respective services and implements rudimentary error handling.
- `find_optimal_commute` combines results from different sources, ready to analyze them further for recommendations.
- Note that URLs used in the `fetch_data` method are placeholders; replace them with actual service API endpoints.

This is a foundation; production-level applications should handle data privacy, scalability, more sophisticated error management, etc.
